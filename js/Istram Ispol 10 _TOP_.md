In this article, we will review some of the main features and benefits of Istram Ispol 10, and show you how it can improve your workflow and productivity.
 
## Mapping Project
 
One of the first steps in any civil engineering project is to obtain reliable and updated data about the terrain and the environment. With Istram Ispol 10, you can import georeferenced data from various sources, such as CAD files, orthophotos, point clouds, LiDAR or GPS. You can also create your own surveys using drones or mobile devices.
 
Istram Ispol 10 allows you to visualize and edit your data in 2D or 3D, using powerful CAD tools and orthophoto tools. You can also perform geotechnical analysis, such as slope stability, soil classification or bearing capacity. You can generate contour lines, cross sections, profiles and reports with ease.
 
## Design Project
 
Once you have your mapping project ready, you can start designing your civil engineering project using Istram Ispol 10. You can choose from a variety of templates and standards for different types of projects, such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels or dams. You can also customize your own parameters and criteria according to your needs.
 
Istram Ispol 10 allows you to design your project in 3D, using parametric objects that adapt to the terrain and the geometry. You can also simulate different scenarios and alternatives, such as traffic flow, drainage system or environmental impact. You can check for errors and conflicts using clash detection and quality control tools. You can generate plans, drawings, quantities and budgets with ease.
 
## Monitoring Project
 
The final step in any civil engineering project is to monitor its execution and maintenance. With Istram Ispol 10, you can connect your design project with the real world, using sensors, cameras or drones. You can track the progress and performance of your project in real time, using dashboards and indicators. You can also compare the actual data with the planned data, and detect any deviations or anomalies.
