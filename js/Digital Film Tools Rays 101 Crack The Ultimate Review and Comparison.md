In this article, we will show you how to use Digital Film Tools Rays to create stunning light ray effects in a few simple steps. We will use Adobe Photoshop as an example, but you can follow the same steps in any other compatible software.
 
## Step 1: Open your image in Photoshop
 
First, open your image in Photoshop and make sure it is in RGB mode. You can check this by going to Image > Mode > RGB Color. If your image is not in RGB mode, you will need to convert it first.
 
## Step 2: Launch Digital Film Tools Rays
 
Next, launch Digital Film Tools Rays from the Filter menu. Go to Filter > Digital Film Tools > Rays. This will open a new window where you can see a preview of your image with the default rays effect applied.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the ray settings
 
Now you can adjust the ray settings to suit your image and your creative vision. You can use the on-screen control to change the direction of the rays by dragging it around. You can also use the sliders on the right panel to change the length, brightness, color, threshold, source point, randomization, and texture of the rays. You can see how each slider affects your image by hovering over it and reading the tooltip.
 
You can also use the masking tools at the bottom of the window to define where you want the rays to appear or not appear. You can use the Add Mask button to create a mask that covers the entire image, and then use the Erase or Paint tools to erase or paint over the areas where you want to remove or add rays. You can adjust the size, hardness, and opacity of the brush by using the corresponding sliders.
