By analyzing the execution plan, you can identify potential bottlenecks and optimize your query accordingly.
 
Another feature of FBScanner is its ability to monitor the database configuration and performance parameters. You can see the values of various settings and statistics, such as page size, cache size, sweep interval, garbage collection, fetches, reads, writes, etc. You can also compare the values of different databases or different time periods. This can help you to fine-tune your database configuration and achieve optimal performance.
 
FBScanner is not only a tool for performance optimization, but also a tool for performance auditing and security. You can use it to track all the SQL activity on your Firebird server, including who executed what query, when and from where. You can also filter the SQL traffic by user name, IP address, application name, etc. This can help you to detect unauthorized or suspicious access, as well as to comply with various regulations and standards.
