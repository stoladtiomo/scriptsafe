## What is Design Emocional and Why is it Important?
 
Design emocional is a term coined by Donald Norman in his book of the same name. It refers to the way that products and services evoke emotional responses from users, and how these emotions affect their behavior, satisfaction, and loyalty.
 
According to Norman, there are three levels of design that influence our emotions: visceral, behavioral, and reflective. Visceral design is about the immediate and instinctive reactions that we have to the appearance and feel of a product. Behavioral design is about the usability and functionality of a product, and how it performs in different situations. Reflective design is about the meaning and value that we assign to a product, and how it relates to our identity and culture.
 
Design emocional is important because it can make or break a product or service. A product that appeals to our emotions can create a positive and memorable experience, while a product that ignores or violates our emotions can cause frustration and dissatisfaction. Emotions also influence our decision-making and loyalty, as we tend to prefer products that make us feel good and avoid products that make us feel bad.
 
Therefore, designers need to understand how emotions work and how to design for them. By applying the principles of design emocional, designers can create products and services that are not only functional and reliable, but also enjoyable and meaningful.
  
## How to Apply Design Emocional to Your Projects
 
If you want to apply design emocional to your projects, you need to follow some steps and guidelines. Here are some tips from Donald Norman himself on how to design for emotions:

- Know your users. Research their needs, preferences, goals, motivations, and emotions. Use methods such as interviews, surveys, observations, personas, scenarios, and user testing to gather data and insights.
- Define your objectives. What are you trying to achieve with your product or service? What emotions do you want to elicit from your users? How do you want them to feel before, during, and after using your product or service?
- Design for the three levels of emotion. Consider how your product or service affects the visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotion. Use elements such as color, shape, texture, sound, animation, feedback, affordances, constraints, simplicity, consistency, personalization, storytelling, branding, and social interaction to create emotional appeal.
- Evaluate your design. Test your product or service with real users and measure their emotional responses. Use methods such as questionnaires, interviews, facial expressions analysis, physiological measurements, eye tracking, and brain imaging to collect data and feedback.
- Iterate your design. Based on the results of your evaluation, identify the strengths and weaknesses of your design. Make changes and improvements to enhance the emotional experience of your users.

By following these steps and guidelines, you can apply design emocional to your projects and create products and services that are not only functional and reliable but also enjoyable and meaningful.
