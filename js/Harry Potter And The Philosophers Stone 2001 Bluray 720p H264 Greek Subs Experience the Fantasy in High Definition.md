The movie and the book have some differences, such as the title. In the United Kingdom and most other countries, the book and the movie are called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which refers to a mythical object that can turn any metal into gold and produce an elixir of life. However, in the United States and some other countries, the book and the movie are called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which is a more familiar term for American audiences. The change was made by the publisher Scholastic, who thought that American children would not be interested in a book with "philosopher" in the title.
