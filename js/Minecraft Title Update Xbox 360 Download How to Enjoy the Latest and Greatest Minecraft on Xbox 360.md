- You can also play online with other players who have the same title update as you. Just make sure you are signed in to Xbox Live and join or host a multiplayer game.
- You can explore the tutorial worlds that were created by 4J Studios for each title update. These are worlds that teach you how to play Minecraft and showcase some of the features added in each update. You can find them in the "Play Tutorial" option in the main menu.
- You can also download some custom maps made by other players for different title updates. You can find them on websites like <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/projects/tag/xbox</p> 8cf37b1e13{-string.enter-}
