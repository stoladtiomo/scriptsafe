Why do you need the Windows Media Player HTML5 Extension for Chrome?
 
HTML5 is the latest standard for web development that aims to make the web more interactive and multimedia-rich. HTML5 supports native video and audio playback without requiring any plugins or external applications. This means that you can watch videos and listen to music directly in your browser, without having to download or install anything.
 
However, not all browsers support the same video and audio formats for HTML5. Chrome, for example, does not support H.264 or AAC codecs, which are commonly used for online video streaming. This means that some HTML5 videos may not play in Chrome, or may play with poor quality or performance. This can affect your online video experience, especially if you use Chrome as your main browser.
 
The Windows Media Player HTML5 Extension for Chrome solves this problem by enabling Chrome to use the Windows Media Player plugin to play HTML5 videos that use H.264 or AAC codecs. This way, you can enjoy watching HTML5 videos in Chrome on Windows 7 without any issues.
  
What are the benefits of using the Windows Media Player HTML5 Extension for Chrome?
