## How to Choose a Good Fake Book for Jazz
 
Not all fake books are created equal. Some are more accurate, comprehensive, and user-friendly than others. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a good fake book for jazz:

- The quality of the notation. A good fake book should have clear and consistent notation, with correct spelling of chords, accidentals, and enharmonics. It should also have accurate rhythms, articulations, and dynamics.
- The variety of the repertoire. A good fake book should have a wide range of jazz styles, genres, and eras, from swing to bebop to fusion. It should also have songs by different composers and performers, both famous and obscure.
- The availability of the recordings. A good fake book should have songs that are easy to find and listen to on various platforms, such as YouTube, Spotify, or iTunes. This will help you compare the fake book version with the original version and learn from the best.
- The format and layout. A good fake book should have a convenient size and shape, with durable binding and paper quality. It should also have a logical and intuitive organization, with alphabetical or thematic indexes, table of contents, and page numbers.

Some examples of popular and reliable fake books for jazz are:

- The Real Book by Hal Leonard. This is one of the most widely used fake books in the world, with over 400 songs in various editions and instruments. It has high-quality notation and covers a broad spectrum of jazz styles and artists.
- The New Real Book by Sher Music. This is another comprehensive fake book series, with over 300 songs in each volume. It has more modern jazz tunes than The Real Book, as well as some Latin, Brazilian, and fusion songs.
- The Jazz Fake Book by Hal Leonard. This is a classic fake book that contains over 500 songs from the early days of jazz to the 1970s. It has a simple and elegant notation style and includes some rare and obscure tunes.

Of course, these are not the only fake books available for jazz. You can also find fake books for specific styles, artists, or instruments. For example, there are fake books for vocal jazz, blues, bossa nova, Django Reinhardt, or saxophone.
 
The important thing is to choose a fake book that suits your needs and preferences, and use it as a tool to enhance your learning and enjoyment of jazz.
