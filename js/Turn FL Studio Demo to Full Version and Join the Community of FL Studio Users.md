# How to Download and Use Cubase 5.5.3 Dongle Emulator
 
Cubase is a popular digital audio workstation (DAW) software that allows you to record, edit, mix and produce music. However, to use Cubase, you need a USB dongle key that contains the license information and activates the software. This can be inconvenient if you lose or damage your dongle, or if you want to use Cubase on multiple computers.

Fortunately, there is a way to emulate a virtual dongle key and use Cubase without the physical device. A dongle emulator is a software that mimics the functionality of a dongle and tricks Cubase into thinking that it is connected to a real dongle. This way, you can download and install Cubase 5.5.3 on any computer and use it without any limitations.
