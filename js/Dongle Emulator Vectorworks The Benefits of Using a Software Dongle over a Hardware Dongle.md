# How to Use a Dongle Emulator for Vectorworks
 
Vectorworks is a design software that requires a USB dongle to run. A dongle is a small device that plugs into your computer and acts as a license key. However, dongles can be lost, stolen, damaged, or incompatible with newer computers. In such cases, you may want to use a dongle emulator, which is a software that mimics the function of a dongle without needing the physical device.

A dongle emulator can help you backup your dongle, run Vectorworks on multiple computers, or use Vectorworks without internet access. However, dongle emulators are not officially supported by Vectorworks and may violate their terms of service. Therefore, you should use them at your own risk and only for legitimate purposes.
 
There are different types of dongles and emulators for Vectorworks, depending on the version and license you have. The most common ones are Sentinel SuperPro, UltraPro, SHK, and iKey. To use a dongle emulator for Vectorworks, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install the appropriate dongle driver for your OS from the Vectorworks website or from the link below[^1^]. You may need to uninstall any previous drivers first.
2. Unplug the dongle from your computer and plug it into another computer that has Vectorworks installed.
3. Run a software that can read and dump the data from your dongle, such as Sentinel Emulator 2007 or Vip Dongle Team[^2^]. Follow the instructions on how to create a dump file (.dng) of your dongle.
4. Copy the dump file to the computer where you want to use the emulator.
5. Run a software that can create and install a virtual dongle from your dump file, such as MultiKey or Vip Dongle Team[^2^]. Follow the instructions on how to create and install a virtual device (.reg) of your dongle.
6. Restart your computer and run Vectorworks. It should recognize the virtual dongle as if it was the real one.

Note: You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall software before installing the emulator, as some of them may detect it as malware. You may also need to run the emulator software as administrator or in compatibility mode. If you encounter any problems with the emulator, you can try using different versions of the software or contact the developers for support.

Vectorworks is a powerful and versatile design software that can handle 2D drafting, 3D modeling, rendering, and BIM (Building Information Modeling) for various disciplines, such as architecture, landscape, interior, lighting, and entertainment. Vectorworks offers many benefits for designers who want to express their creativity and deliver high-quality projects.
 
Some of the benefits of using Vectorworks are:

- It has a flexible and intuitive interface that adapts to your workflow and preferences. You can customize your workspace, menus, palettes, tools, and shortcuts to suit your needs and style.
- It supports cross-platform compatibility, meaning you can work on Windows or Mac OS with the same file format and features. You can also collaborate with other designers who use different software, thanks to its import and export capabilities for various file types.
- It has a wide range of industry-specific tools and features that cater to different design disciplines and scenarios. You can use Vectorworks Architect for architectural design and documentation, Vectorworks Landmark for landscape design and site analysis, Vectorworks Spotlight for lighting design and event planning, Vectorworks InteriorCAD for interior design and furniture production, and Vectorworks Vision for previsualization and cueing.
- It has a powerful 3D modeling engine powered by SIEMENS Parasolid that allows you to create complex and organic shapes with ease. You can also use parametric objects, subdivision surfaces, NURBS curves and surfaces, solids modeling, and direct editing to achieve your desired results.
- It has a built-in rendering engine that lets you produce realistic and stunning images and animations of your designs. You can also use Renderworks styles, textures, lights, cameras, backgrounds, and effects to enhance your visuals.
- It has a comprehensive BIM solution that enables you to create intelligent and data-rich models of your buildings and landscapes. You can use smart objects, data tags, worksheets, reports, schedules, IFC export/import, clash detection, quantity takeoff, energy analysis, site information modeling (SIM), georeferencing, GIS integration, and more to streamline your design process and coordination.

With Vectorworks, you can unleash your creativity and productivity while delivering high-quality designs that meet your clients' expectations and standards.
