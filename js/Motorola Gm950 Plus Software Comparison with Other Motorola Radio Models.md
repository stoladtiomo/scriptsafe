If you have a Motorola Gm950 Plus radio and want to program it on your Windows 10 computer, you might face some challenges. The original programming software for this radio is designed for DOS and Windows 3.1, which are not compatible with modern operating systems. However, there is a way to overcome this problem by using a software emulator called Dosbox and a USB cable. In this article, we will show you how to set up the software environment and program your radio with ease.
 
## What You Need
 
Before you start, you need to gather the following items:
 
**DOWNLOAD âœ« [https://t.co/HhmRQ5DTkC](https://t.co/HhmRQ5DTkC)**


 
- A Motorola Gm950 Plus radio and its power supply.
- A USB programming cable for the radio. You can use a MaxtonData (RPC-MM-U) cable, which works well with this radio[^1^]. You can find it on Amazon, AliExpress or eBay.
- A copy of the Motorola RSS programming software for the Gm950 Plus. You can search for it online, but be careful of malware.
- A copy of Dosbox, a software that emulates a DOS environment on your Windows 10 computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.dosbox.com/).
- A copy of Windows 3.1 or 3.11, which is the operating system that the programming software requires. You can find some premade Windows 3.1 packs that you can drop into your Dosbox path on some abandonware websites. Alternatively, you can install it yourself by following [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/230359/how-to-install-windows-3.1-in-dosbox-set-up-drivers-and-play-16-bit-games/).

1. Install Dosbox on your Windows 10 computer and locate its configuration file (dosbox.conf).
2. Edit the configuration file and make some changes to it. In the [cpu] section, use these settings to make sure Dosbox is not running too fast:
`core=normal
cputype=pentium_slow
cycles=fixed 2500
cycleup=10
cycledown=20`
3. In the [serial] section, use these settings to enable the communication between your USB cable and Dosbox:
`serial1=directserial realport:COM1 rxdelay=100
serial2=dummy
serial3=disabled
serial4=disabled`
Note: If COM1 is in use by another device on your computer, you can use another COM port number, but make sure to adjust it in both Dosbox and Windows 3.1 later.
4. Save and close the configuration file.
5. Plug in your USB cable and go to the Windows Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager. Locate the COM & LPT entry and double click on your USB cable device.
6. Change the COM Port Number to match the one you used in Dosbox (e.g., COM1). Also make sure that the FIFO buffer is off. Click OK and close the Device Manager.
7. Copy the Motorola RSS programming software folder into your Dosbox path (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74).
8. Copy or install Windows 3.1 into your Dosbox path as well (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74\Windows).
