The epic of Gilgamesh begins with a prologue that introduces the main character and his achievements. Gilgamesh is described as two-thirds god and one-third human, and as the builder of the great walls of Uruk. He is also a tyrannical ruler who oppresses his people and forces them to work on his projects. The gods hear the complaints of the people and decide to create a rival for Gilgamesh, a wild man named Enkidu, who lives in harmony with the animals in the forest.

A hunter discovers Enkidu and reports him to Gilgamesh, who sends a temple prostitute named Shamhat to seduce him and civilize him. Shamhat succeeds in luring Enkidu away from his animal companions and teaches him the ways of humans. She also tells him about Gilgamesh and his exploits, and Enkidu decides to challenge him. He travels to Uruk and confronts Gilgamesh at the gate, where they engage in a fierce battle. After a long struggle, they recognize each other as equals and become friends.
 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu embark on a series of adventures together, seeking fame and glory. They travel to the Cedar Forest, where they slay the guardian monster Humbaba, who was appointed by the god Enlil to protect the forest. They also kill the Bull of Heaven, who was sent by the goddess Ishtar to punish Gilgamesh for rejecting her advances. These acts anger the gods, who decide to punish them by killing Enkidu. Enkidu falls ill and has a series of dreams that foretell his death. He curses Shamhat and the hunter who brought him to civilization, but then regrets his words and blesses them. He dies in agony, leaving Gilgamesh heartbroken.
